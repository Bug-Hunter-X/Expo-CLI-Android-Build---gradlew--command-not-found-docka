The provided solution focuses on ensuring Gradle is correctly accessible to the Expo build system.  This may require adjusting environment variables or explicitly setting the path to Gradle within the build script.  One possible approach (if `gradlew` is in a standard location) is to explicitly set the JAVA_HOME variable, assuming that Gradle is found in the JAVA_HOME/bin directory.  This can be done within the shell environment before running the Expo CLI commands, or within the build script itself. This solution is not universally applicable, and individual adjustments based on the user environment might be necessary.
